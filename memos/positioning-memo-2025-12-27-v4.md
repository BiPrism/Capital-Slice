## LOCATION ANALYSIS

### Morning Positioning

**Truck A → Eastern Market (Score: 60)**
Even during Christmas week, Eastern Market draws local residents for the flea market. The holiday modifier reduces expectations, but it remains the strongest morning option. Cold weather (43°F at opening) may delay peak crowds until late morning.

**Truck B → Dupont Circle (Score: 50)**
Dupont provides steady foot traffic from the Metro hub. Holiday week means fewer office workers, but the residential population and visitors create baseline demand. Position near the Circle for maximum visibility.

### Afternoon Strategy

**Truck A: Relocate Eastern Market → Georgetown Waterfront**
- Stay score: 5 (Eastern Market dies in afternoon)
- Relocate score: 70 - 15 (penalty) = 55
- **Decision: RELOCATE** (gain of +50 points)
- Georgetown's waterfront and holiday ice skating draws afternoon crowds despite the cold.

**Truck B: Relocate Dupont Circle → National Mall**
- Stay score: 35
- Relocate score: 65 - 15 (penalty) = 50
- **Decision: RELOCATE** (gain of +15 points)
- Some tourists visit the monuments during Christmas week. Cold but dry conditions make the Mall viable.

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Primary Risk: Reduced Holiday Traffic
Christmas week typically sees 20-30% lower foot traffic across all locations. All predictions are calibrated for reduced volume.

### Secondary Risk: Cold Weather
Morning temperatures in the low 40s may suppress early traffic. Consider:
- Delayed opening (9 AM instead of 7 AM)
- Hot beverages as add-on if available

### Backup Plans

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Eastern Market closed | Truck A → Columbia Heights (morning fallback) |
| Rain develops | Both trucks → Dupont Circle (covered areas nearby) |
| Georgetown too cold/empty | Truck A stays at Eastern Market area |
| Unexpected Arena event | Truck B pivots to Arena instead of Mall |

---

## EXPECTED PERFORMANCE

**Forecast:** 20-30% below typical Saturday revenue

This is a challenging day due to:
1. Christmas week holiday suppression
2. Cold temperatures (43-47°F)
3. No sports events at Arena
4. No major conventions or festivals

**Realistic expectations:**
- Morning will be slow; peak around 10 AM - 12 PM
- Afternoon will be the better half if weather holds
- Georgetown ice skating crowd is the best opportunity
