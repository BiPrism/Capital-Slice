## LOCATION ANALYSIS

### Morning Positioning
**Eastern Market** (Score: 90) is the clear morning leader. The weekend flea market draws consistent traffic regardless of season, and 57°F is comfortable for outdoor browsing. The Capitol Hill crowd values quality pizza.

**Dupont Circle** (Score: 80) provides reliable secondary positioning with steady metro foot traffic. The affluent neighborhood maintains weekend activity even during the holiday lull.

### Afternoon Strategy
Both trucks should **relocate** after the morning shift:

**Truck A → Georgetown Waterfront** (Score: 100)
- Relocate Value: 100 - 15 = **85**
- Stay at Eastern Market: **35**
- Decision: +50 point gain justifies relocation

**Truck B → National Mall** (Score: 95)
- Relocate Value: 95 - 15 = **80**
- Stay at Dupont Circle: **65**
- Decision: +15 point gain justifies relocation

The mild weather (57°F, no rain) makes outdoor waterfront and Mall locations viable despite late December. Tourist traffic remains active during the holiday week between Christmas and New Year's.

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

**Primary Risk:** Weather shift. If afternoon cloud cover thickens to drizzle or temperature drops significantly, Georgetown Waterfront and National Mall values will decrease sharply.

**Backup Plan:**
- If precipitation develops by midday, abort relocation plans
- Truck A stays at Eastern Market (covered areas available)
- Truck B relocates to Columbia Heights instead (weather-resilient)

**Secondary Risk:** Post-holiday lull. Tourist traffic may be lighter than typical December weekends as visitors return home after Christmas.

---

## EXPECTED PERFORMANCE

This is a **moderate opportunity Saturday**. With no major sporting events or festivals, we're relying on baseline location strength and favorable weather. Expected performance is approximately **10-15% above a typical winter Saturday** due to mild conditions enabling outdoor locations that would otherwise be compromised.

The holiday week between Christmas and New Year's typically brings tourists and families, which aligns well with pizza-by-the-slice service.
