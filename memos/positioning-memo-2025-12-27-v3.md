## RISK ASSESSMENT

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Eastern Market closed/reduced | Medium | High | Verify Thursday; backup to Columbia Heights |
| Weather deteriorates (rain) | Low | High | Monitor Friday; abort outdoor relocations if >40% precip |
| Lower than expected holiday traffic | Medium | Medium | Accept reduced volume; focus on quality service |
| Convention Center opportunity missed | Low | Low | If major event confirmed, consider for morning |

### Backup Plan

**If Eastern Market closed or very slow:**
- Truck A morning: Columbia Heights (score 30)
- Truck B stays at Dupont Circle

**If precipitation develops by midday:**
- Truck A: STAY at Eastern Market (covered areas)
- Truck B: Columbia Heights instead of Mall

---

## EXPECTED PERFORMANCE

**Assessment:** Low-Moderate opportunity Saturday

This is a challenging day:
- Christmas week significantly reduces baseline traffic (-20 modifier)
- No sports events to drive crowds
- Cool weather limits outdoor appeal

**Expected vs Typical Saturday:** -20% to -30%

**Positive Factors:**
- Some holiday tourists visiting DC
- Ice skating attractions draw afternoon crowds
- Dry weather enables outdoor locations
- Lower competition (other vendors may skip holiday week)

**Revenue Expectation:** Below average but viable. Focus on efficiency and quality service rather than volume.
