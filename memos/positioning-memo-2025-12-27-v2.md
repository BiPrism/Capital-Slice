## RISK ASSESSMENT

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Weather shift (rain/temp drop) | Medium | Monitor forecast Friday; abort relocation if >40% precip |
| Convention Center opportunity missed | Low | If major event confirmed, consider for Truck B afternoon |
| Eastern Market holiday closure | Low | Verify Thursday; backup to Columbia Heights |
| Post-holiday tourist lull | Medium | Accept lower volume; premium pricing still viable |

### Backup Plan
If precipitation develops by midday:
- Truck A: STAY at Eastern Market (covered areas)
- Truck B: Relocate to Columbia Heights instead of Mall

---

## EXPECTED PERFORMANCE

**Assessment:** Moderate opportunity Saturday

With no major sporting events, we rely on baseline location strength and mild weather. The holiday week typically brings family tourists, a good demographic for pizza-by-the-slice.

**Expected vs Baseline:** +10-15% above typical winter Saturday

**Confidence in Estimate:** [MODERATE] - Weather variance and holiday patterns add uncertainty
